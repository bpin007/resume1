    <big><b>Analysis of soil slope Stability by using Geo studio Software</b></big>
    <hr/>
    <pr>It is the analysis of soil stability in slope areas, by using
        total station, basic laboratory test and Geo studio
        Software. From this project we can predict slip ratio of
        the slope in other words to determine strength of the
        slope
